# tkey/Visa POC

This is a proof of concept to explore how tkey works and if Visa authentication solutions can be incorporated into Torus' MPC solution. This POC will be incorporated into other POCs to eventually construct a fully fleshed-out crypto product. This repo does not contain confidential Visa information. 

To get started run:
'npm install' then
'npm run start'
